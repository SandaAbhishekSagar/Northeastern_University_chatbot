# Railway Deployment Guide - University Chatbot

## ✅ Your Code is Production-Ready!

Everything is set up for Railway deployment. Follow these simple steps:

---

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Create Railway Account**

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Login" or "Start a New Project"
3. Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email

### **Step 2: Install Railway CLI (Optional but Recommended)**

**Windows:**
```powershell
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

**Or use Railway Web UI** (no CLI needed)

### **Step 3: Deploy Your Project**

#### **Option A: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)**

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - University Chatbot"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/university-chatbot.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Railway:**
   - Go to [railway.app/new](https://railway.app/new)
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will auto-detect your Python app!

#### **Option B: Deploy via Railway CLI**

```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### **Step 4: Set Environment Variables**

**In Railway Dashboard:**

1. Go to your project → Variables tab
2. Add these variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
USE_CLOUD_CHROMA=true
```

**Optional variables:**
```
PORT=8000  (Railway sets this automatically)
```

### **Step 5: Deploy!**

Railway will automatically:
- ✅ Detect Python
- ✅ Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Run the start command from `Procfile`
- ✅ Assign a public URL

**Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`**

## 📊 Expected Performance on Railway

### **Initial Deployment:**
- Build time: 3-5 minutes (first time)
- Memory usage: ~500-800 MB
- Response time: 3-10 seconds per query
- Cost: $5/month (Hobby plan) or $0 (Trial credits)

### **After First Request:**
- Cold start: 2-3 seconds (if idle)
- Warm requests: 3-10 seconds (normal)
- Documents searched: All 80,000
- Search time: 0.1-0.5 seconds

---

## 🌐 Testing Your Deployment

### **1. Check Health Endpoint**

```bash
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health/enhanced
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Enhanced OpenAI Northeastern University Chatbot API is running",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "device": "cpu",
  "embeddings_cached": 123,
  "features": {
    "hybrid_search": true,
    "query_expansion": true,
    "confidence_scoring": true,
    "gpu_embeddings": false
  }
}
```

### **2. Test Chat Endpoint**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/chat/enhanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is the co-op program?",
    "session_id": "test-session"
  }'
```

### **3. Access API Documentation**

```
https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/docs
```

### **4. Frontend Setup (Optional)**

If you want to deploy the frontend too:

**Option 1: Separate Railway Service**
- Create another Railway service for frontend
- Deploy `frontend/` folder
- Update `script.js` API URL to your Railway backend URL

**Option 2: Static Hosting (Netlify/Vercel)**
- Deploy `frontend/` to Netlify or Vercel (free)
- Update API URL in `script.js`
- Faster and cheaper for static files

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Build Fails**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Common issues:
# 1. Missing environment variables → Add in Railway dashboard
# 2. Dependency conflicts → Check requirements.txt versions
# 3. Python version → Ensure runtime.txt has python-3.9.18
```

### **Problem: App Crashes on Start**

**Check logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

**Common causes:**
1. Missing `USE_CLOUD_CHROMA=true` → Add to environment variables
2. Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` → Add to environment variables
3. Import errors → Check all dependencies installed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Should show:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
# USE_CLOUD_CHROMA=true
```

### **Problem: Slow Responses**

**Expected behavior:**
- First request: 5-15 seconds (cold start + model loading)
- Subsequent requests: 3-10 seconds (normal)

**If consistently slow (>30s):**
1. Check OpenAI API status: [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com)
2. Check Railway CPU/Memory usage in dashboard
3. Consider upgrading Railway plan if at limits

### **Problem: ChromaDB Connection Fails**

**Check:**
```python
# In Railway logs, you should see:
[OK] ChromaDB Cloud client created (PRODUCTION MODE)
    Connected to Chroma Cloud
    Ready for production deployment
```

**If you see errors:**
1. Verify `USE_CLOUD_CHROMA=true` is set
2. Check `chroma_cloud_config.py` has correct credentials
3. Test connection locally first:
   ```bash
   $env:USE_CLOUD_CHROMA="true"
   python -c "from services.shared.database import get_chroma_client; client = get_chroma_client()"
   ```

## 📈 Monitoring Your Deployment

### **Railway Dashboard**

Monitor in real-time:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Request logs
- Error logs
- Build history

### **Custom Metrics Endpoint**

Your app includes a metrics endpoint:

```bash
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/metrics
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "total_queries": 42,
  "avg_search_time": 0.3,
  "avg_llm_time": 6.2,
  "avg_total_time": 7.1,
  "avg_confidence": 0.82,
  "health_status": "healthy"
}
```

---

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Checklist

---

## 🚀 Advanced: CORS Configuration (If Needed)

If you deploy frontend separately and get CORS errors:

Update `services/chat_service/enhanced_openai_api.py`:

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "https://your-frontend-domain.netlify.app"
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
