## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Factors

### 1. Performance Optimization (Most Important)
**Challenge**: Achieving 1-2s response is very ambitious

**Required Actions**:
- ‚úÖ Use premium GPU (RTX 4090 or better)
- ‚úÖ Implement aggressive caching (Redis)
- ‚úÖ Use fast LLM API (GPT-4o-mini)
- ‚úÖ Optimize vector search
- ‚úÖ Parallel processing architecture

**Realistic Timeline**: 3-4 weeks of dedicated optimization

**Alternative**: Start with 2-3s target, optimize to 1-2s based on real data

### 2. Career Advice Quality
**Challenge**: Ensuring high-quality, relevant career recommendations

**Required Actions**:
- ‚úÖ Collect comprehensive career data
- ‚úÖ Validate with career counselors
- ‚úÖ Implement structured prompts
- ‚úÖ A/B testing for quality

**Timeline**: 2 weeks development + ongoing refinement

### 3. Cost Management
**Challenge**: Staying within budget during optimization phase

**Required Actions**:
- ‚úÖ Set billing alerts ($1,000/month hard limit)
- ‚úÖ Monitor GPU usage daily
- ‚úÖ Implement query caching aggressively
- ‚úÖ Use spot instances for testing

**Risk**: Could exceed budget by 20-30% during optimization
