# Railway Deployment with Pinecone Vector Database

## 🎉 Migration Complete!

Your **76,428 documents** have been successfully migrated from local ChromaDB to Pinecone! This guide will help you deploy your application to Railway with Pinecone support.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Pinecone API key (already configured)
- ✅ 76,428 documents migrated to Pinecone
- ✅ Railway account
- ✅ GitHub repository connected to Railway

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

In your Railway project, add these environment variables:

```bash
# Pinecone Configuration
PINECONE_API_KEY=pcsk_4sFz9N_Pd57DxSRmmp9jFDhwRCE9HpyWFYh5tAbE8ZrSBbkeYxcmBEfhknSGQpuwR3JKt6
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1-aws
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=northeastern-university

# Application Configuration
RAILWAY_URL=https://your-railway-app-url.up.railway.app
```

### 2. Railway Configuration

Your `railway.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python start_production.py",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health/enhanced",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### 3. Production Start Script

The `start_production.py` script will automatically:
- Initialize Pinecone connection
- Load the enhanced GPU chatbot
- Start the FastAPI server

### 4. Health Check Endpoint

Your application includes a health check endpoint at `/health/enhanced` that will:
- Verify Pinecone connection
- Report document count
- Show database type
- Display system features

## 🔧 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Railway Logs

After deployment, check the Railway logs for:
```
✅ Pinecone database initialized
✅ Enhanced GPU chatbot initialized successfully!
✅ FastAPI server started
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint

Visit: `https://your-railway-app-url.up.railway.app/health/enhanced`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "Enhanced GPU Northeastern University Chatbot API is running",
  "response_time": 0.123,
  "device": "cuda",
  "features": {
    "gpu_acceleration": true,
    "llm_available": true,
    "database_type": "pinecone",
    "document_count": 76428,
    "query_expansion": true,
    "hybrid_search": true,
    "confidence_scoring": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Test Chat Endpoint

Send a POST request to `/chat`:
```json
{
  "question": "What courses are available at Northeastern University?",
  "session_id": "test_session"
}
```

## 🌟 Benefits of Pinecone Migration

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "PINECONE_API_KEY not found"
**Solution**: Ensure the environment variable is set in Railway dashboard

### Issue: "Failed to connect to Pinecone"
**Solution**: Check your API key and internet connectivity

### Issue: "Document count is 0"
**Solution**: Verify the index name matches your migrated data

### Issue: "Health check fails"
**Solution**: Check Railway logs for startup errors

## 📊 Migration Summary

- **Documents Migrated**: 76,428
- **Database**: Pinecone (northeastern-university index)
- **Embedding Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions)
- **Metadata**: Optimized for 40KB limit
- **Batch Size**: 100 documents per batch

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway**: Push your code and Railway will automatically deploy
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Add PINECONE_API_KEY in Railway dashboard
3. **Test the API**: Use the health endpoint to verify deployment
4. **Update Frontend**: Ensure your frontend points to the new Railway URL
5. **Monitor Performance**: Check Railway metrics and Pinecone usage
