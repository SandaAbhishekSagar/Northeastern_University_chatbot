### GPT-4o-mini (Recommended)

**New Pricing per Query**: ~$0.003 - $0.0045 (was $0.0015)

| **10 queries/day** | $0.03-0.045 | $0.90-$1.35 | $11-$16 |
| **100 queries/day** | $0.30-0.45 | $9-$13.50 | $108-$162 |
| **1000 queries/day** | $3-$4.50 | $90-$135 | $1,080-$1,620 |

**Still very affordable!** Even at 100 queries/day, you're only paying ~$9-13.50/month.

## üîÑ How to Adjust

If you want to **balance between detail and cost**, you can modify `max_tokens`:

Edit `services/chat_service/enhanced_openai_chatbot.py`:

```python
# Current setting (very detailed)
max_tokens=2500

# Options:
max_tokens=2000  # Still detailed, slightly lower cost
max_tokens=1500  # Moderate detail
max_tokens=1000  # Brief (original setting)
```

**Recommended**: Keep at `2500` for best user experience. The cost difference is minimal for most use cases.
